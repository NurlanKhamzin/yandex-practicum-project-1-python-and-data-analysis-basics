# 📝 Project Description
The comparison between Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths:

- Moscow is seen as a metropolis driven by the strict rhythm of the workweek.

- St. Petersburg is viewed as a city with a unique culture, unlike Moscow.

Some of these myths reflect reality. Others are empty stereotypes. Businesses need to distinguish between the two to make rational decisions. Using real data from Yandex Music, you’ll test hypotheses and compare user behavior in the two capitals.

# 🔍 Hypotheses
1. User activity depends on the day of the week, and this manifests differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

2. On Monday mornings, different music genres dominate in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The same applies to Friday evenings.

3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different music genres. Pop music is more popular in Moscow, while Russian rap is more common in St. Petersburg.

# 📊 Data
The data is stored in the file yandex_music_project.csv.

Column Descriptions:
- userID — user identifier

- Track — track title

- artist — artist name

- genre — genre name

- City — user's city

- time — time when the track was played

- Day — day of the week

# ✅ Project Review
Your work will be reviewed by an experienced analyst. They’ll help you improve the project by evaluating:

- The results of each task

- Adherence to Python syntax rules

- Code style

The reviewer will return with feedback within 24 hours. For example, they might suggest simplifying a complex piece of code. You’ll then be able to revise your project and submit an updated version.

The project is considered complete once all corrections are approved.

⚠️ Note: If you run notebook cells out of order, you may encounter errors — for instance, trying to access an object that hasn’t been loaded into memory yet. Before contacting a reviewer or instructor, try clearing all objects from memory and restarting the code. In Jupyter Notebook, you can do this via: Kernel → Restart & Run All
